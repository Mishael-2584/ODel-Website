## üìä Performance Comparison

### BEFORE
```
Loading Academic Year ‚Üí Schools ‚Üí Departments
Each navigation = API call
Total time = 8 seconds + 8 seconds + 8 seconds = 24 seconds
User sees: "Loading..." for long periods
```

### AFTER
```
Loading Academic Year ‚Üí Schools ‚Üí Departments
First navigation = API call (8 seconds, cached)
Second navigation = Cache (instant, <100ms)
Third navigation = Cache (instant, <100ms)
Total experience = 8 seconds ‚Üí instant returns
User sees: Smooth, fast navigation
```

## üöÄ How It Works

### The Caching System
1. **First Load**: API fetch ‚Üí store in cache with timestamp
2. **Cache Hit**: Check if data exists AND timestamp < 5 minutes
3. **Cache Valid**: Return from cache instantly ‚úÖ
4. **Cache Expired**: Delete and fetch fresh from API
5. **Auto-Refresh**: Every 5 minutes, cache automatically refreshes

### Console Messages Show Status
```javascript
‚úó Fetching root categories from API        // First load
‚úì Loading root categories from cache       // Cached load

‚úó Fetching children for category 789       // First load of category
‚úì Loading children for category 789 from cache  // Cached
```
